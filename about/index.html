                <p> For the summer of 2021 I was granted the experience to work in the Lumberyard team (now O3DE) under AWS Game Tech as an SDE Intern for the Amazon Propel Program. During my time, I aided the company in the transition from an older 3D game engine (Lumberyard) to a new open-sourced game engine called Open 3D Engine (O3DE). I did that by beautifying the prefab files which entailed implementing functions in C++ to generate more descriptive unique entity names for prefab files based on user input and modifying functions to generate more concise prefab files free of default containers allowing the file to be more readable. Through this experience I was able to enhance my skills in software development as well as learning to be adaptable when working with something new. </p>

                <p> Throughout my time in college I realize that the success rate for black students in coding-related majors such as Computer Science and UI/UX design was very low and when searching for a community I came to a stand still as I advanced further into my college career. I noticed how many people are drawn away from these majors after the first few classes because of the rigor and competitiveness. Because of this, I was happy to help when approached with the opportunity to start a new club for minority students in coding on campus. This club will focus on creating a community amongst minority students while also providing resources for academic and professional success. </p>

                <p> Coming from a majority black Elementary and High School, University of Michigan was a big adjustment. The environment was very new and the people were very unfamiliar. I wanted a community that benefitted me academically and professionally while also allowing me to feel comfortable in the space: NSBE did just that. NSBE was a community which exemplified black excellence while also looking out for its members. From day 1, I felt a sense of family within the organization that was unmatched. Because of the positive impact of NSBE on me, I decided to join the Junior Executive Board to help freshmen get that same experience. <br><br> The Junior Executive Board allowed me to plan events for freshmen to welcome them into the nsbe community and set them off on the right path early. I went on to join the executive board where I served as the Programs Chair which was aimed at planning events to help the betterment of the members in the organization as a whole. NSBE is a community that I am proud to be apart of and joining the organization has opened so many doors for me. </p>

                <p>The Posse Foundation scholarship is a merit-based tuition scholarship awarded by the posse foundation which aims to develop the next generation of leaders. After three rounds of interview, I was privelleged to receive this scholarship to attend the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. Being a posse scholar included weekly trainings with the other 9 members of our cohort. <br><br>These trainings consisted of discussions on different controversal topics that we may approach in college as well as work places. These trainings allowed us to be leaders who took into consideration all aspects of the community. The scholarship also includes mentorship throught the first two years of college. Overall, the posse program was a big factor in my life as it set me on the right path for my personal and professional goals.

                <p> The College of Engineering at the University of Michigan have traveled to Chicago during their Spring Break to work with students in Chicago Public Schools. We have worked to introduce engineering to high school students, model successful college students, and to represent the University of Michigan as a university interested in having them apply. Being from Chicago, I really appreciated being apart of this program because it allowed me to help encourage and increase the students from Chicago Public Schools going into engineering and stem fields.</p>
