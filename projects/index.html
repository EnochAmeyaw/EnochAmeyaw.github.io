                Using Java and xml on android studios, I was able to develop a budget tracker that categorizes different purchases into user-determined categories. Users are able to access their past transactions withthe date and time they were logged. This app was implemented using classes as well as different data structures such as maps and vectors. Features were also made available through the use of different GUIs. As this was an academic project, access to the code is not permitted.

                Using Java on Intellij, I was able to develop a Wheel of fortune game simulator that allows single or multiplayer participation in the gam. Users are asked to input the number of player and the word that the players will be guessing. Players are able to by a vowel for 250 points as well as spin the wheel for a chance to win points. <br><br>This game was implemented using classes as well as different data structures such as maps and vectors. A window GUI was used to display the game and alert the user of errors or if they have guessed the word correctly/incorrectly. The game was implemented using  As this was an academic project, access to the code is not permitted.

                This web application was developed by my team and I using HTML CSS and Javascript. Leftovers is a web application that allows users to discover new recipes by performing searches with singular ingredients.The ingredients are fetched through the mealdb api so some ingredients may not appear. Upon searching the ingredient an array of cards appear that contain the recipe name and its image. <br><br>On each card there is a button that allows users to see the full recipe along with a supplementary video to create the recipe. The recipe names, directions, and video are all derived from the API. This application is built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We used repl.it to host our site which can be found <a href="https://leftovers.emilnkemdilimda.repl.co/" target="_blank">here</a>. This site is intended to be used on any device.

                Throughout my time at Michigan, I had the amazing opportunity to work with the School of Information, led by Dr. Barbara Ericson, to work on interactive e-books to improve computing education. I had the chance to work on all aspects of the project including researching its effectiveness, contributing different interactive questions to the book, and using the book alongside others to mentor students in introductory CS classes. <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/py4e-int/ack/AA-contrib.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is a link to one of the E-books created which is used to teach an introductory python class at Michigan..
